## Description
Experian reports that the average FICO score in the US stands at 715. Although there isn't a one-size-fits-all 'average consumer,' credit bureaus rely on various quantifiable trends and data to assess creditworthiness. In this project, we aim to identify demographic and psychographic factors linked to higher and lower average credit scores. We'll employ fundamental concepts like data cleaning and statistical analysis to explore the impact of factors such as payment history, debt-to-income ratio, and age of accounts on an individual's credit score.
