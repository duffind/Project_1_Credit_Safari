# Consumer Credit Analysis
## Project 1: Team Credit Safari


## Description
Experian reports that the average FICO score in the US stands at 715. Although there isn't a one-size-fits-all 'average consumer,' credit bureaus rely on various quantifiable trends and data to assess creditworthiness. In this project, we aim to identify demographic and psychographic factors linked to higher and lower average credit scores. We'll employ fundamental concepts like data cleaning and statistical analysis to explore the impact of factors such as payment history, debt-to-income ratio, and age of accounts on an individual's credit score.

## Research Questions
What are the three primary positive behavioral patterns correlated with 	elevated credit scores?

What are the three principal adverse behavioral patterns associated 	with diminished credit scores?

In which geographic region do we observe the highest mean credit scores?
